# BillBoARd
AR app that makes ad information more interactive and the products within the ad more easily accessible. 


## Summary
Billboards are used as image targets in augmented reality to display more information about a given billboard. The additional information shown in AR could include maps, links, images, and more.


## MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

An AR application that includes 2-3 components for users to interact with, showing more information about the billboard. It is up to the team's discretion what these components should be. The MVP should be functional on at least 3 unique billboards.



## Stretch Goals

- Categorize billboards by industry (i.e fashion, entertainment, technology)
- For billboards displaying products, show 3D models instead of images
- If the team decides to use maps for components, find current location & nearby locations to generate directions

# BillboARd
Bring a new dimension to advertising with BillboARd, an augmented reality app that provides a more engaging experience to ad viewers. As of now this mobile app works on Android devices. 

## Features 

### 3D Models 
Users can view 3D models and animation by scanning billboards, which adds another layer of depth to otherwise flat advertisements.

### Video Overlay
Billboards come to life with video when users view them through their mobile device. This can be used to display more information than would normally fit on a poster and enhance the visual impact.

### Screenshots
Users can save an image of any interactive feature with the tap of the button. These images are then saved to user's native phone gallery and can be shared with others.

### Gallery
The app includes a page of all the possible billboards a user can scan and link to extra information about the product in case they do not have access to a poster.
